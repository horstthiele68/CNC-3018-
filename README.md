MAJOR ISSUES WITH THIS MACHINE USING LASER AND SPINDLE AND GRBL 
DON'T ADD LIMIT SWITCHES, SEND THE MACHINE INTO ALARM MODE WITH NO NOTICE OF ANY KIND
AFTER HAVING REMOVED THE HOMING SWITCHES I STARTED HAVING SUCKSESS HOW EVER THE NANO NEEDED RE-FLASHING 
INITIAL TESTING OF THIS MACHINE WAS THROUGH EASEL ITS THIS PROGRAM THAT FROZ AT EVERY MACHINE ERROR HAVING SWITCHES REMOVED FIX THIS
NOW TESTING THE LASER USING LASERGRBL LASER DOES TURN ON BUT WILL NOT BURN OTHER PROGRAMS RUN THROUGH THE MOTIONS BUT WONT TURN THE LASER ON.
THIS IS AS FAR AS I HAVE GOTTEN I'M THINKING IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH PWM AND SOFTWARE SETTINGS WHICH I HAVE PLAYED AROUND WITH BUT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE LASER SETTINGS.... WILL THIS MEAN I WILL NEED TO REFLASH THE NANO AGAIN AND BACK AGAIN IF I NEED TO USE THE SPINDLE ?????
